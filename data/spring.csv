1,"The 48-105 studio, called Foundation II, is the second studio in CMU?s professional B.Arch program.  It builds on the lessons from 48-100 about clear architectural communication and abstract spatial-definition, but adds a greater emphasis on the material and experiential understanding of how architecture is made and used.  We continue to emphasize architectural drawing and models (both analog and digital) as the primary means of architectural communication, but also as a method of creatively exploring and rigorously testing fundamental architectural ideas.  We investigate, research, analyze, diagram, and apply lessons from local architecture, and great architecture of the past, in studio, and in the parallel survey of architectural history.   We introduce the use of ?systems,? ?computational thinking,? and ?rules? in the design process to create order, deal with a range of parameters, and satisfy specific performance criteria.  Beginning with more abstract formal design exercises, and ending with the design of a small building, we explore how tectonics, joinery, materials, as well as site, orientation, context, and human use can be harnessed to inspire great design.  The design process is still carefully controlled, but students are encouraged to begin to speculate and take careful risks.",48-100,62-123,Architecture Design Studio: Foundation II,15.0,Architecture,"Damiani, Gerard",Freshman,48-105
2,"Architecture is not only building, technology, drawings, etc., but also discourse, meaning, communication, and concept: or theory. This architectural history seminar will study in roughly chronological order some of the major theories and theoreticians of architecture from Vitruvius through the Renaissance, the Enlightenment, the 19th-century, up to the modern era. Throughout the seminar we will chart the changing definitions of what constitutes theory in architecture, and how it relates to other writings such as criticism and history. Well study in-depth how (if at all) theory relates to the intellectual context and built works before and after the writings. Students will discover how ideas on topics such as structure, expression, sustainability, form, and materials reoccur, and even the oldest theories have contemporary relevance. Work for the seminar will involve extensive readings, active class discussions, and a term paper on pre-20th-century architectural theory and how it relates to contemporary ideas.",None,None,History of Architectural Theory,9.0,Architecture,"Gutschow, Kai",Junior,48-311
3,"The basis for the CMU studio course sequence is the expectation that the student retains and applies knowledge gained each semester to the current studio. The spring semester of the third year of architectural studies at Carnegie Mellon University is concerned with the detailed development and refinement of an architectural design as informed by the technical knowledge of structural systems, enclosure systems and the process of construction. The student is expected to articulate concepts and develop designs with more precision and in greater detail than done in previous studios and courses. In addition to criteria related to the development of design skills appropriate to ones sixth semester of the studio sequence, the following criteria are an explicit part of the evaluation of the student work: Aesthetics: The degree to which the design responds to formal issues as articulated in prior design studios. Structural System: The degree to which the proposed building is presented as a statically stable structure which defines the spatial order and satisfies the architectural intentions made explicit in the project. Enclosure System: The degree to which the proposed enclosure system satisfies the design requirements and responds to the physical phenomena of the environment into which it is placed. Material Selection: The degree to which the selected building materials and their implementation are appropriate to the occupancy, articulate the architectural order, and satisfy the physical design requirements. Constructability: The degree to which the proposed building is developed in response to an understanding of the processes of construction.  Presentation: The clarity, craft and completeness of the presentation.",48-300,None,Architecture Design Studio: Integration II,18.0,Architecture,"Lee, Stephen",Junior,48-305
4,"Building on the fall studio, the spring semester is concerned with more in-depth understanding and development of designs for small-scale buildings, now informed by greater knowledge related to materials, fabrication, and the act of construction.  Following the New Materiality evident in architecture today, and acknowledging the importance of materials and assembly techniques for sustainable design, we seek to explore the aesthetic and experiential meaning of materials (WHY?), and the technical knowledge related to the use of materials and the processes of construction (HOW?).  The creative opportunities and design implications of using varied materials, structural systems, fabrication and assembly techniques--both analogue and digital--are elaborated, especially as they determine the artistic, conceptual, poetic, creative, spatial, and experiential aspects of architecture.

It focuses attention on the 20th-century, and investigates the web of interwoven ideas and issues that characterize the modern age and ?modernism.?  We begin with a look at the crisis of modernity that plagued most of western civilization in the late 19th-century, and then survey the major movements of the avant-garde and other responses to modernity, and end with what came to be known as ?Post-Modernism.?  We will look more closely at the increasing divide between the ?disciplinary? edge of architecture, and architecture?s increasing ?professionalization? in the last century, focusing on how architecture has influenced culture through experimentation and provocative thinking, even when the primary intent was functional, technological, social, political, etc. Emphasis will be placed on the relationship of buildings to the more general cultural, intellectual, and historical circumstances in which they were created.

This course is intended to serve as an introduction to the evolution of urban spaces and the function of the architecture within them. It is organized chronologically and will examine the impact of indigenous philosophical principles as well as Hindu, Buddhist and Confucian concepts on the organization of villages, capital cities, and religious centers. The course will begin in the Indus Valley. We will examine Indian Hindu and Buddhist cave monasteries as well as freestanding Hindu temples and identify the salient architectural forms that identify each type. We will then move to China where the earliest villages were arranged according to ideas about nature and the organizing system of fengshui. We will then move through urban organization and Buddhist temples in Korea to Japan where the Chinese model was adopted for early Japanese capitals. Chinese, Korean and Japanese religious centers will be studied as examples of both indigenous ideas and the adoption of Buddhist beliefs and temple organization. The examination of the Japanese warrior culture will include castles, new ideas in residential architecture, the Pleasure Quarters, and retirement villas. Contemporary architecture will be addressed through group projects that will examine specific structures from an Asian country of their choice. Each group will situate the modern buildings within the cultural and historic circumstances that led to their creation and propose ways that modern building design could be used in their own future work",48-240,None,History of Asian Architecture,9.0,Architecture,"Linduff, Katheryn",Senior,48-442

18,"In the Fall 2017 and Spring 2018 there will be some changes to the shop electives offered.   First the Spring Furniture Design and Construction course  48564 will no longer be offered because that content is incorporated within the Furniture Studio in the fall.  Next, the two shop mini courses previously offered in the fall will each be expanded to become full electives, one in the fall and one in the spring. The prerequisite for both of these classes is documentable experience with the band saw, table saw (ripping and crosscut), drill press and the belt and disk sander.   The Hand and Machine Joinery, New Directions, is scheduled Tuesday and Thursday mornings 10:30 am to 11:50 in the spring 2018, and will be a 9 unit elective running the entire semester.  The elective will focus on building a free standing (or hung) cabinet with doors.  If enrolled students have taken the Exploring Pattern course in the fall the doors made in that class will be mounted on the cabinet.  If students have not taken that course then a pair of simple doors will be made instead.  The primary goal of this course will be to learn the steps of making a simple cabinet using hand and machine joinery.  Quality of craft will be of great importance.   Uniqueness of design will not be emphasized, however individuation of the cabinet will still be possible throughout the construction, starting with choices between a wall mounted or free standing (with legs) cabinet, the selection of hardwoods, the specific size of parts, and the selection of particular detail options.  The construction process will be carefully staged with demonstrations continuing throughout the semester.  The cabinet will be perpendicular and rectangular.

21,"The primary goal of this mini is to help students formulate a robust proposal for the 5th year Thesis, but it could be used to create a proposal for any grant, scholarship or academic research project.  A series of weekly workshops, readings, discussions, and guest lectures will help students move from wide-open initial ideas about issues they are curious about and seek to explore, to the development of a rigorous research process that builds on existing knowledge and attempts to develop new ideas and advances the discipline.  The class will explore the difference between design and research in architecture, how different research methods and modes of representation can be leveraged, and how concepts of disciplinarity and project can focus a topic.   Students will begin to identify precedents, key readings and a research bibliography, an overview of the general topic they will research in depth, a detailed plan for a years worth of independent thesis work, and a well-defined end-product, likely a design proposal.  An important task will be to identify advisors who can support, guide, and critique your work, who can act as intellectual collaborators as much as evaluators.

What does it take, technically, to achieve net zero and what else, beyond technical requirements, advances or impedes a net zero future? 48-752 is a graduate level class that explores net zero energy design and construction in the residential sector. Through case studies and applied projects, we will explore what it takes to achieve quantitative net zero in residential buildings while maintaining occupant comfort and satisfaction. In locations where net zero is now required, we will examine the results of those requirements. At the outset, we will discuss specific definitions of a net-zero building and the implications of each definition. Through case studies, lectures, field trips, outside reading and assignments, we will examine how a net-zero building is achieved, including the use of renewable energy to achieve the net-zero balance. We will apply lessons learned from metered examples to real sites and to new design or renovation projects in Pittsburgh and will use simulation software to test and quantify the impact of our design/renovation strategies. We will also compare our strategies to requirements in US codes and rating systems such as IECC-2012 and LEED for Homes to evaluate their impact in moving the US residential sector toward much higher performance buildings.

304,"Most photographs tell stories. We see photographs in newspapers, magazines, snapshot albums, on the web, in books, and in posters. In these contexts photographs often work with words to convey meaning, whether they are shown with captions, news stories, or just with titles. Photographs can work without words, too, to create purely visual narratives.  In this course, students will make two series of photographs: one that is fiction and one that is non-fiction. In addition to making photographs, students will determine the context in which their photo-stories will be seen. Students may make photo books, for example, or decide that their images will be seen on a website.  While students are making photographs, we will explore the rich traditions of photo-graphic story-telling that range from the world-oriented work of photo-journalist W.

307,"Invented in 1839, photography was a form of visual expression that immediately attracted a large public following. Starting around 1900, photography was practiced with two dominant strands.  One of these firmly believed in the power of photographs to provide a window on the world, and was led by Lewis Hine, whose documentary photographs for the National Child Labor Committee helped to ameliorate living and working conditions for thousands of immigrant children.  The other strand adhered to the philosophy of Alfred Stieglitz who adamantly affirmed that photographs were first and foremost reflections of the soul and were art objects, equal to painting, drawing and sculpture.  These two schools of thought guided photographers throughout the twentieth century.   This course explores in depth the tremendous range of photographic expression since World War II and examines in particular the contributions of significant image-makers such as Helen Levitt, W. Eugene Smith, Robert Frank, Diane Arbus, Garry Winogrand, Charles Teenie Harris, Cindy Sherman, Carrie Mae Weems, Nan Goldin, James Nachtwey, and many others.

Patents and other technology rights are increasingly valuable to businesses, and are no longer limited to large manufacturing or scientific companies. Start-ups and mid-sized firms in numerous industries use technology rights to increase their return on innovation and innovative activity. When used effectively, these legal tools can lead to significant and sometimes surprising business advantages. Patent rights can enable small companies to prevent copying by competitors, earn higher revenue from licensing technology, and compete more effectively against much larger firms. Knowledge of technology rights can provide a powerful competitive advantage and provide many nonintuitive  opportunities. In addition, these legal mechanisms can be made even more effective if they are integrated with the organizations innovation processes: the way that organizations manage the conception, development, and production of new products, services, technologies, and business models. This is in contrast to the more common practice of treating innovation and patenting as distinct and consecutive processes. Highly innovative organizations develop new products and technologies guided in part by the patents and other technology rights that can eventually enhance value. This course is believed to be unique in its focus on the complete innovation life cycle.

1027,"This course provides students with the tools to understand patents and technology rights, and how these assets can be utilized in a firms innovation processes. Patents and other technology rights are increasingly valuable to businesses, and are no longer limited to large manufacturing or scientific companies. Start-ups and mid-sized firms in numerous industries use technology rights to increase their return on innovation and innovative activity. When used effectively, these legal tools can lead to significant and sometimes surprising business advantages. Patent rights can enable small companies to prevent copying by competitors, earn higher revenue from licensing technology, and compete more effectively against much larger firms. Knowledge of technology rights can provide a powerful competitive advantage and provide many nonintuitive  opportunities. In addition, these legal mechanisms can be made even more effective if they are integrated with the organizations innovation processes: the way that organizations manage the conception, development, and production of new products, services, technologies, and business models. This is in contrast to the more common practice of treating innovation and patenting as distinct and consecutive processes. Highly innovative organizations develop new products and technologies guided in part by the patents and other technology rights that can eventually enhance value. This course is believed to be unique in its focus on the complete innovation life cycle. It treats intangible assets like patents and business strategies as part of the process of developing innovations.

This course (one of two minis students can choose to fulfill their FYW requirement) focuses upon interpreting and making arguments using mainly numerical data but also qualitative data. We will look at research in a range of disciplinesincluding psychology, education, medicine, engineering, and the sciencesand note how writers select and analyze the data they collect. We will also examine what happens to this research when it is picked up by the popular media. Students will also practice collecting and analyzing their own data and reporting it to suit the needs of various stakeholders. There are two primary audiences for this section. Students in data-driven majors will find the section useful preparation for communicating in their disciplines. Students in other fields will learn how to critique and respond to the many ways that numbers shape our lives. This section presumes a basic ability to calculate averages, percentages, and ratios, but no advanced mathematical or statistical preparation. Instead, this section provides a fascinating look at how numbers and words intersect to create persuasive arguments in academic, professional, and popular contexts. Students will compare and analyze texts that make arguments with data, practice rhetorical strategies for synthesizing and representing data so that by the end of the class, students will apply these strategies to write an original data-driven research proposal.",None,None,Writing about Data,4.5,English,"Pollak, Calvin",Freshman,76-107

By analyzing a range of proposal texts, we will identify the different kinds of legwork necessary to write a successful proposal, arguably one of the most challenging aspects of writing a persuasive recommendation for change. We will examine how writers unpack problems rhetorically and use evidence to argue solutions for different stakeholders who may not share common values.

1091,"It is well-known that there is a gender wage gap in the United States: on average, a woman performing the exact same work as a male colleague will make 78-82 of his salary. What is less well-known is that a major factor contributing to this wage gap is that women are simply less likely to ask for a raise or negotiate for a high starting salary. However, the solution is not as simple as telling women to ask for raises: recent research also shows that (unlike men) when women do ask for more money, they are perceived as unlikeable and difficult. This course will look at how gender-based stereotypes affect how we perceive and respond to different communication acts. The exact same sentencespoken with the exact same body language and intonationcan often elicit different reactions depending on whether the speaker is a man or a woman. Such stereotypes harm and limit both men and women. Just as a woman asking for a raise may be perceived as pushy or difficult, a man trying to console a male friend is often perceived as weak and unlikeable. This course will identify some of these stereotypes and then look at research suggesting what steps we can take to minimize their impact. For instance, we will examine how companies can take steps to minimize gender bias in written employee performance evaluations. We will examine strategies women can use to ask for a raise without being perceived negatively. We will develop strategies for responding to biased language and perceptions.

In this course, we will ask how narratives work rhetorically to shape how we perceive and encounter events, movements, places, and experiences. Students can expect to read and discuss narrative theories and practice employing these theories to analyze story artifacts, such as written collections, political speeches, newspaper articles, curated experiences, and oral histories. We will begin the semester by exploring and analyzing the many stories surrounding September 11 but will also consider the stories that infuse recent or local subjects of interest. Students will investigate the effect these and other narratives have on contemporary contexts. Any student who is interested in developing a critical awareness of the rhetorical power of storytelling and enhancing their analytical toolkit will benefit from this course.  Most class sessions will involve guided student discussions of theoretical texts as well as collaborative opportunities to analyze story artifacts.

This is the point of view often taken by analysts who work for universities, think tanks and intelligence agencies who seek to understand cultural trends and mindsets from volumes of digital texts. For such analysts, close reading is an indispensable part of their work and computing tools help focus their reading while reading helps refine their understanding of the computer output.

Literary Journalism is a genre that reports on the world through stories that have been put through the lens of an individual writers sympathetic imagination.   Literary Journalism is always about the revelation of people and events, as influenced by social structures and ideas in a particular time and place. And again, unlike traditional journalism, the point of view of the writer is not supposedly neutral. What makes this kind of non-fiction engaging often comes down to point of view. A writer is telling us a story they know well, either through observation or personal experience. Writers telling stories in this genre are opinionated, and often full of personality and voice.

Regardless of the language people speak and the cultures that may have shaped our beliefs and values, we are bound together by professional interests and political agendas in a community that has no choice but to function well. In the current international environment, some of the most important and rewarding employment opportunities are with multinational and international corporations. But are we prepared for the challenge of working with professionals from all over the world? Even as more people around the globe learn English, specific cultural values, beliefs, and assumptions continue to influence the way in which they communicate. More often than not there is a whole different worldview behind a foreign accent. Globalization brings along several pressing questions:  How can professional communicators avoid the potential for misunderstanding and conflict that comes with cultural difference? How can professional communicators contribute to shaping a workplace discourse that can reach a wide, diverse, global audience? How can professional global communication be effectively planned, measured, and improved?

We study the structure of written texts  the semi-conscious rules people use to organize paragraphs, for example  as well as the unconscious rules that organize oral discourse such as spontaneous stories and arguments. We study how people signal their intended audience-interpretations of what they say as foreground or background information, a casual remark or solemn promise, more of the same or change of topic. We look at how grammar is influenced by what people need to do with language, and how discourse affects grammar over time. We ask how children and other language learners learn how to make things happen with talk and writing. We ask how people learn what language is for, from exchanging information to writing poetry to perpetuating systems of belief. We analyze the choices speakers and writers make that show how they see themselves and how they relate to others.

User-testing to discover the representations readers are in fact creating can be critical for many kinds of writing, from informative websites, to persuasive arguments, or engaging accounts.

This view of legal discourse is disputed by critics who point out the figurative aspects of legal language, the relevance of character, emotion, and narrative in legal communication, and the ways in which law protects social structures of power such as race, class, and gender privilege. The course broadly examines the fraught relationship between rhetoric and law by considering the ways in which a variety of legal discourses serve to construct and reinforce identities, with a particular focus on the ways in which legal systems are portrayed to reflect the ideals of democracy to suit particular foreign relations goals. We begin by studying the ways in which Cold War foreign policy goals influenced desegregation and civil rights discourse in the United States, then we turn to the ways in which the prosecutions of deposed authoritarian rulers in various regions of the globe have been orchestrated to persuade global audiences that emerging democracies observe the rule of law for purposes of garnering international support.

1136,"It is well-known that there is a gender wage gap in the United States: on average, a woman performing the exact same work as a male colleague will make 78-82 of his salary. What is less well-known is that a major factor contributing to this wage gap is that women are simply less likely to ask for a raise or negotiate for a high starting salary. However, the solution is not as simple as telling women to ask for raises: recent research also shows that (unlike men) when women do ask for more money, they are perceived as unlikeable and difficult. This course will look at how gender-based stereotypes affect how we perceive and respond to different communication acts. The exact same sentencespoken with the exact same body language and intonationcan often elicit different reactions depending on whether the speaker is a man or a woman. Such stereotypes harm and limit both men and women. Just as a woman asking for a raise may be perceived as pushy or difficult, a man trying to console a male friend is often perceived as weak and unlikeable. This course will identify some of these stereotypes and then look at research suggesting what steps we can take to minimize their impact. For instance, we will examine how companies can take steps to minimize gender bias in written employee performance evaluations. We will examine strategies women can use to ask for a raise without being perceived negatively. We will develop strategies for responding to biased language and perceptions.

We study how people signal their intended audience-interpretations of what they say as foreground or background information, a casual remark or solemn promise, more of the same or change of topic. We look at how grammar is influenced by what people need to do with language, and how discourse affects grammar over time. We ask how children and other language learners learn how to make things happen with talk and writing. We ask how people learn what language is for, from exchanging information to writing poetry to perpetuating systems of belief. We analyze the choices speakers and writers make that show how they see themselves and how they relate to others. (Choices about how to address other people, for example, both create and reflect relationships of power and solidarity). We study how people define social processes like disease, aging, and disability as they talk about them, and how language is used to mirror and establish social relations in institutional settings like law courts and schools as well as in families and among friends. This course touches on a selection of these topics and gives students practice in analyzing the complex nuances of language.

To gain insight into the why behind the surprising things readers do with a text, we will draw on the psychology of reading, where socially constructed memory networks, cognitive schemas, and meta-knowledge actively shape interpretation. User-testing to discover the representations readers are in fact creating can be critical for many kinds of writing, from informative websites, to persuasive arguments, or engaging accounts. Turning then to writers, we will examine the key processes, from interpreting the task, to planning, revision and metacognitive awareness on which expert and novice writers differ. You will also learn a set of process-tracing methods for tracking these problem-solving strategies as you do two case studies. One will uncover the (sometimes radical) differences in how a set of readers actually interpret (construct the meaning of) a text you choose. The second will be an extended case study of your own thinking process on a real task you are doing outside this class.

How do we teach writing so that students can effectively adapt their strategies to new writing situations? What knowledge about writing processes and texts should teachers have to design meaningful learning experiences for developing writers? How do we assess what our students have learned? We will approach these questions by reading from a variety of disciplines, including writing studies, second language writing studies, educational psychology, and instructional design. First we will conceptualize the learner as reader and writer, bringing diverse experiences and abilities to the classroom, so that we can design accessible instruction. We will then grapple with the questions about what we should teach our students, or which genres should students learn to write.

This course introduces the challenges transnational feminism has posed to Western notions of feminism. To explore these contestations, we will look at a series of controversies. This course will take six case studies concerning cultural practices that have generated global debates about the status of women and issues like consent, freedom, and equality. Beginning with several works about regional/Islamic practices of veiling, we will look specifically at the close connections made between womens practices and elements of tradition, including religion. With an eye toward historicizing feminist interventions, we will look at 19th century debates on sati, commonly called widow burning, in India, to see how certain issues became loci for global intervention during colonial periods and, later, for global feminist movements. Within the contemporary period, we will turn to cultural, economic and political practices like female genital cutting, transnational domestic labor, global sex trade, and transnational forced marriage.

This view of legal discourse is disputed by critics who point out the figurative aspects of legal language, the relevance of character, emotion, and narrative in legal communication, and the ways in which law protects social structures of power such as race, class, and gender privilege. The course broadly examines the fraught relationship between rhetoric and law by considering the ways in which a variety of legal discourses serve to construct and reinforce identities, with a particular focus on the ways in which legal systems are portrayed to reflect the ideals of democracy to suit particular foreign relations goals. We begin by studying the ways in which Cold War foreign policy goals influenced desegregation and civil rights discourse in the United States, then we turn to the ways in which the prosecutions of deposed authoritarian rulers in various regions of the globe have been orchestrated to persuade global audiences that emerging democracies observe the rule of law for purposes of garnering international support.

Its goals are: first, to familiarize students with ways that historians think about their research, how they carry it out, and how they debate findings with other historians; second, to train students in best practices for doing historical research in primary and secondary sources. We discuss how to ask questions about the past and develop a one-semester research topic, find appropriate primary and secondary sources, take notes from those sources, and write a paper that answers an original question using skills we have studied. In the Spring 2019 semester, we will use the topic of the history of witchcraft and witch-hunting to focus the class.  Although Western beliefs in witchcraft and devil worship dated back to antiquity, the 16th and 17th centuries witnessed the Great European Witch-Hunt, which cost the lives of thousands across Europe and in its American colonies. Ever since, historians have struggled to explain why fears of witchcraft suddenly became so acute in this period.  And although the witch-hunts in early modern Europe and its colonies gradually came to an end, beliefs in witchcraft persist into the modern era and, in many parts of the world today, continue to generate campaigns of popular violence against alleged perpetrators. In this course, well examine both primary historical sources and secondary scholarship to explore competing interpretations of this complex historical puzzle.

We begin by examining the Qing not just as the last of Chinas imperial dynasties but also as an early-modern, multi-ethnic empire that included Mongolia, Tibet, and Xinjiang. In fact, Chinas last emperors were actually Manchus from northeast Asia. Secondly we investigate the social, economic, intellectual and demographic developments that transformed late-imperial China prior to the coming of the West. Thirdly, we examine Qing responses to a string of nineteenth-century disruptions, including but not limited to western imperialism, that threatened to not only end the dynasty but also challenged the very tenants of Chinese civilization.

1285,"Invented in 1839, photography was a form of visual expression that immediately attracted a large public following. Starting around 1900, photography was practiced with two dominant strands. One of these firmly believed in the power of photographs to provide a window on the world, and was led by Lewis Hine, whose documentary photographs for the National Child Labor Committee helped to ameliorate living and working conditions for thousands of immigrant children. The other strand adhered to the philosophy of Alfred Stieglitz who adamantly affirmed that photographs were first and foremost reflections of the soul and were art objects, equal to painting, drawing and sculpture. These two schools of thought guided photographers throughout the twentieth century.

Fossil-fueled industrialization, chemical engineering, and resource-intensive consumerism have generated immense wealth, but they have also left long-term, cumulative legacies of toxic pollution and ecological harm.  While these legacies affect everyone, their impacts are by no means evenly distributed.  In this course, we will use the tools of anthropology, political ecology, and history to examine experiences of toxic exposure in different parts of the world, including Pittsburgh.  Our analyses will ask how inequalities of race, class, and gender shape exposure as well as how cultural differences create divergent understandings of ecology, health, and their interrelationship.  We will consider, moreover, how these disparities shape what people know about pollution and whether/how they demand accountability for it.  Cases we explore will range from acute industrial disasters (and their aftermath) to the harms experienced by other-than-human beings to the gradual, often invisible exposures that affect all of us to varying degrees.",None,None,Hostile Environments: The Politics of Pollution in Global Perspective,9.0,History,"Theriault, Noah",Graduate,79-780

1395,"The ability to secure information within a modern enterprise is a growing challenge. Threats to information security are global, persistent, and increasingly sophisticated. Long gone are the days when managers could hope to secure the enterprise through ad hoc means.   Effective information security at the enterprise level requires participation, planning, and practice.  Fortunately, the information security community has developed a variety of resources, methods, and best practices to help modern enterprises address the challenge. However, employing these tools demands a high degree of commitment, understanding, and skill-attributes that must be sustained through constant awareness and training.  An essential part of the information security plan is cyber security policy - this includes the written plans for how the enterprise IT assets will be protected.   This course provides students with information on the origin of cyber security policy, governance structures for policy creation, selection and implementation of policy, and audit and control functions to ensure compliance and efficacy. Students will be exposed to the national and international policy and legal considerations related to cybersecurity and cyberspace such as privacy, intellectual property, cybercrime, homeland security (i.e., critical infrastructure protection) and cyberwarfare, and the organizations involved in the formulation of such policies. Broader technology issues also are discussed to demonstrate the interdisciplinary influences and concerns that must be addressed in developing or implementing effective national cybersecurity laws and policies.",None,None,Cybersecurity Policy and Governance I,6.0,Information Systems:Sch of IS & Mgt,"Butkovic, Matthew",Graduate,95-744

Rather, successful policy is the result of thorough research, careful drafting, and successful navigation within the government or non-government organization whose leadership may ultimately promulgate it.  The course begins with a brief review of government and organizational behavior in a bureaucracy, and the identification of a federal agencys current policy system as a framework to which we will turn throughout the term.  Study then turns to an overview of legal research skills.  Though usually the province of law students and attorneys, such skills will enable students to know when policy may be crafted from scratch -- or where, when, and how policy must conform to larger governing legal or regulatory structures.

However, their societies, politics, and cultural production often have followed divergent paths, leading to a current juncture characterized by both fraternity and adversity.

1838,"The Alexander Technique is a dynamic and powerful process of education that gives us a practical knowledge of simple yet profound principles which govern human co-ordination. This process teaches us to observe and experience how we approach our lives, both physically and mentally. The technique enables us to recognize and release patterns of tension by redirecting excessive effort into useful energy, resulting in improved balance, flexibility and co-ordination.

Although they are often masked by overarching terms such as ?common-practice tonality,? the differences between Corelli and early Beethoven in terms of basic compositional practice ? that is, in terms of harmony, meter, and form ? represent a fundamental change in musical language.  In contrast, the differences between Mozart and Mahler simply represent different stages within a single evolutionary development.    Guided by readings from music theory and historical musicology, as well as by our own analyses of scores, this course will attempt to chart these developments across three musical styles that overlap both in time and in substance: the baroque, the galant, and the classical.  Focusing especially on composers from Bach to Mozart, the twin goals will be the ability to understand individual works in relation to their own style-historical moments, and an understanding of how musical style changed over the course of the century.

Among many important formal arrival points, which are the most important?

Often, these phrases are used without explicit specification of which entity is being referred to; to understand the phrase, the interpreter has to create an inferential bridge from the definite noun phrase to information already in the discourse.

2175,"Intonation is the melody of speech: how a speakers pitch changes over the course of an utterance, along with the placement of emphasis, or sentence-level stress.  Intonation and stress contribute to the interpretation of utterances in multiple ways. For example, the questions Did BOB go to the store? and Did Bob go to the STORE? contain the same words, but request different information. Similarly, whether the sentence Bob went to the store is interpreted as a statement or as a question, and whether as expressing certainty or uncertainty on the part of the speaker, depends on its intonation. Features of intonation can also convey information about the speakers attitudes and affect: sarcasm and irony, for example, may be signaled by intonation.   The goal of this course is two-fold. First, students will learn about the phonetic correlates of intonation and stress, and learn how to analyze intonation as a system of high and low tones, using the intonation transcription system ToBI.  This will enable students to accurately describe the intonation pattern of an utterance. Second, students will learn how intonation is used to convey semantic and pragmatic information. The course will focus primarily on English, but other languages will be explored to serve as a basis of comparison. There is no prerequisite, and no familiarity with either phonetics or semantics is assumed. The course will be of interest to students interested in learning some of the intricacies of face-to-face linguistic communication. Students in the departments of English, Modern Languages, Language Technology, Human-Computer Interaction, and Psychology will find material relevant to their major topics.

2375,"This mini-course addresses economic evaluation in the health sector.  This sector represents an important and growing part of the global economy.  In 2013 the world spent US 7.83 trillion United States dollars on health care   representing 7.1 of the global economy (GDP).  This spending is expected to rise to 18.28 trillion in constant dollars by the year 2040 or 9.0 of global GDP.  Shares of national economies devoted to health varied four-fold among countries in 2013, being 4.3 of GDP in one of the lowest countries (Democratic Republic of the Congo), 9.4 in Australia, and 17.1 in the United States.  Economic evaluation can help policy makers to guide health technologies to provide good value for these outlays.  The analysis is relevant to countries of all income levels.  Technologies delivering good value deserve encouragement while those with poor value should be limited, insofar as possible.

2376,"In this course you will learn how to gather and synthesize evidence to address this question. Program evaluation is the systematic application of social science methods to assess each aspect of a program: the need for the program, the programs design and implementation, and ultimately the programs impact on relevant outcomes. A completed program evaluation results in (1) information regarding the programs merit, worth, or significance, (2) an accounting of the objective strengths and limitations of this information and (3) the implications of both (1) and (2) for decision making.  Program evaluations differ as much as the social programs they evaluate. Social programs may carry them out internally, or an external organization may be brought in. An evaluation may be highly quantitative or entirely qualitative; it may focus exclusively on needs assessment or assessing program implementation. Evaluations and their results may be highly politically charged or of interest only to direct stakeholders. There are excellent program evaluations that have had tremendous positive impacts on programs and their target populations. There are also poor or flawed program evaluations that provide weaker information than could have been obtained, provide incorrect information, or are misleading.  This course is designed to familiarize the student with the central concepts and methods of program evaluation. Students will be taught how to conduct basic program evaluations as well as how to critique and monitor more comprehensive program evaluations. Successful completion of this course will prepare students to be contributing members of teams that design and carry out program evaluations or that commission program evaluations and make decisions based upon their results.",90-707 or 90-711 or 90-777,None,Program Evaluation,12.0,Public Policy & Mgt:Sch of Pub Pol & Mgt,"Haviland, Amelia",Graduate,90-823
2377,"Individuals and organizations are frequently presented with decisions about how best to allocate limited resources.  Public organizations in particular have an obligation to use consistent and transparent analytic tools to inform tradeoffs among competing policy priorities such as the environment, health, safety, and security.  Economics provides a theoretical foundation for the allocation of scarce resources, but in practice, there are a variety of challenges in measuring benefits and costs in quantitative and monetary terms.  Such challenges include determining how to value benefits and costs experienced in the future, reductions in the risk of premature death and injury, and the distribution of these impacts among affected populations, as well as appropriately characterizing uncertainty.  The ability to assess key assumptions and limitations is critical for both producers and consumers of cost-benefit analysis.  Learning Objectives  Through lectures, discussions, readings, problem sets, written assignments, and presentations, students will develop knowledge and skills that will enable them to:   Apply the analytic tools and techniques of cost-benefit analysis and microeconomics in the formulation and assessment of real-world policies.   Contribute to the development of defensible and transparent cost-benefit analyses.  Understand and identify the assumptions and limitations of cost-benefit analyses.  Critically assess cost-benefit analyses conducted by others.  Evaluate and compare alternative policies using the tools of cost-benefit analysis and microeconomics.

2382,"From the earliest days of the republic to the present, government at all levels (federal, state and local) has invested in the physical and social infrastructure that underpins our now advanced and sophisticated economy.  The resulting fiscal relationships have been controversial, with Washington spending trillions in grants and other assistance, but with conditions, or strings that state and local governments often find onerous and intrusive.  Furthermore, federal budget deficits are now forcing political leaders in Washington to find ways to curtail spending, with many assistance programs potentially on the chopping block and states left to enforce federal standards with less money. This seminar examines the decisions political leaders must make to pay for the public good.  Should highways, for example, be funded by users (through tolls), by vehicle owners (through a gasoline tax) or by all taxpayers (who benefit from highways even if they do not drive)?  Should the federal government be forcing states to implement federal standards, like raising the drinking age as a condition for receiving federal highway funds?  How will such developing technologies and behaviors as electric vehicles and ride sharing change the economics and politics of funding our transportation infrastructure?  How can the federal government balance the budget without shortchanging vital national priorities? The seminar will focus on the tough choices policymakers face over taxation and spending at all levels of government through case studies that illustrate the issues.  Students will develop briefing papers and lead class discussions that explore how federal, state and local interests can align or collide depending on the issue.

2490,"An introduction to programming based on a functional model of computation.  The functional model is a natural generalization of algebra in which programs are formulas that describe the output of a computation in terms of its inputs---that is, as a function.  But instead of being confined to real- or complex-valued functions, the functional model extends the algebraic view to a very rich class of data types, including not only aggregates built up from other types, but also functions themselves as values.  This course is an introduction to programming that is focused on the central concepts of function and type.  One major theme is the interplay between inductive types, which are built up incrementally; recursive functions, which compute over inductive types by decomposition; and proof by structural induction, which is used to prove the correctness and time complexity of a recursive function.  Another major theme is the role of types in structuring large programs into separate modules, and the integration of imperative programming through the introduction of data types whose values may be altered during computation.

This course will focus on analysis of software artifacts--primarily code, but also including analysis of designs, architectures, and test suites. We will focus on functional properties, but also cover non-functional properties like performance and security.  In order to illustrate core analysis concepts in some depth, the course will center on static program analysis; however, the course will also include a breadth of techniques such as testing, model checking, theorem proving, dynamic analysis, and type systems.    Concern for realistic and economical application of analysis will also be evident in a bias towards analyses that are scalable and incremental. The course emphasizes the fundamental similarities between analyses (in their mechanism and power) to teach the students the limitations and scope of the analyses, rather than the distinctions that arose historically (static vs. dynamic, code vs. spec). The course will balance theoretical discussions with lab exercises in which students will apply the ideas they are learning to real artifacts.    After completing this course, students will:        * know what kinds of analyses are available and how to use them      * understand their scope and power, when they can be applied and what conclusions can be drawn from their results      * have a grasp of fundamental notions sufficient to evaluate new kinds of analysis when they are developed      * have some experience selecting and writing analyses for a real piece of software, applying them and interpreting the results    In addition, Ph.D. students taking the 17-754 version of the course will gain a broad overview of the analysis research literature and in-depth knowledge of a particular sub-area through a course project.",None,None,Analysis of Software Artifacts,12.0,SCS: Institute for Software Research,"Gennari, Jeffrey",Graduate,17-754

So far, interaction has been constrained by the limited capabilities of keyboards, joysticks, or computer mice. This creates an exciting opportunity for explorative research on speech input and output, speech-to-speech translation, or any aspect of language technology. Of particular interest will be a combination with other novel real world (RW) input, or output devices, such as mobile phones or portable games consoles, because they can be used to control the VW, or make it accessible everywhere in RW. Language technologies in particular profit from context awareness, because domain adaptation can be performed. For scientific experimentation in that area, Virtual Worlds offer the opportunity to concentrate on algorithms, because context sensors can be written with a few lines of code, without the need for extra hardware sensors. Algorithms can also run continuously, without the need for specific data collection times or places, because the VW is always on.

2720,"Ars, the Latin origin of the word art, means Art and Science. These two fields, which have been separated for a long time, are joining back together in many areas. One of those junctions is where Art and Machine Learning meet. Art in recent years has been moving forward along with the rise of new technologies and scientific discoveries. Machine Learning (ML) is one of the most cutting edge advancements in Computer Science. The popularity and accessibility of frameworks such as Googles Deep Dream system, Pikazo the neural style transfer, Kulitta AI Music Generation Framework, Deep Minds WaveNet, Sonys Flow Machines, and recurrent neural network based language models brought great attention to the marriage of Art and ML methods. The number of ML applications that mimic famous artworks, e.g. The Next Rembrandt project, or even create original artworks such as the robot artist TAIDAs paintings, is rapidly growing. Increasing number of artists are also attempting to use ML methods in their artworks.    This course is project-based and aims to introduce the crossroad of Art and Machine Learning to the broad range of students including both Art and Computer Science majors. We will offer the knowledge of examples, technologies, and issues that connect Art and Machine Learning to the students. Students will study example codes and produce creative applications/artworks using ML methods. Students do not need to have pre-existing knowledge of Machine Learning or experience of Art practice. Students are required to have basic understanding of Python and be open-minded, for example, open to learn the necessary mathematical background and open to discussions on conceptual development and artistic value of their projects.

2724,"Building intelligent machines that are capable of extracting meaningful representations from high-dimensional data lies at the core of solving many AI related tasks. In the past few years, researchers across many different communities, from applied statistics to engineering, computer science and neuroscience, have developed deep (hierarchical) models -- models that are composed of several layers of nonlinear processing. An important property of these models is that they can learn useful representations by re-using and combining intermediate concepts, allowing these models to be successfully applied in a wide variety of domains, including visual object recognition, information retrieval, natural language processing, and speech perception.  This is an advanced graduate course, designed for Masters and Ph.D. level students, and will assume a reasonable degree of mathematical maturity. The goal of this course is to introduce students to the recent and exciting developments of various deep learning methods. Some topics to be covered include: restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs) and their multi-layer extensions Deep Belief Networks and Deep Boltzmann machines; sparse coding, autoencoders, variational autoencoders, convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks, generative adversarial networks, and attention-based models with applications in vision, NLP, and multimodal learning.

2727,"Large datasets are difficult to work with for several reasons. They are difficult to visualize, and it is difficult to understand what sort of errors and biases are present in them. They are computationally expensive to process, and often the cost of learning is hard to predict - for instance, and algorithm that runs quickly in a dataset that fits in memory may be exorbitantly expensive when the dataset is too large for memory. Large datasets may also display qualitatively different behavior in terms of which learning methods produce the most accurate predictions.  This course is intended to provide a student practical knowledge of, and experience with, the issues involving large datasets. Among the issues considered are: scalable learning techniques, such as streaming machine learning techniques; parallel infrastructures such as map-reduce; practical techniques for reducing the memory requirements for learning methods, such as feature hashing and Bloom filters; and techniques for analysis of programs in terms of memory, disk usage, and (for parallel methods) communication complexity.

2756,"This course introduces and develops business concepts that will be useful to new and existing companies, while focusing on robotic technology exemplars.  The concepts begin with how to identify a new idea to for a business that can be effectively started.  Initial ideas often start as a grandiose plan to change the world and these plans are legitimately the fuel that drive new businesses forward.  However, when a company starts (e.g., builds a prototype or writes a  first line of code), what is the least product a company can produce that customers still want and need?  This kernel -- extracted from the big plan-- is a Minimal Viable Product (MVP).   Once an MVP business kernel is formulated, we will learn and study how to understand customer needs, how to market a new idea and how raise and manage money for a new business entity.  These steps abridge information that can be found in an MBA curriculum, but engineers and scientists focused on the technical side will need this information to participate in the process of building companies.  In parallel, we will investigate the marketplace through the stock market.  The stock market is a powerful window into the world of business.  In other words, when a new business is built it has to live inside the competitive environment of every other business.  To understand this eco-system, we will follow several companies in-situ as they go through their own ups-and-downs within the business world.  The course is project based.

It should be of interest to anyone wishing to see the  way statistical ideas play out within the brain sciences, and it  will provide a series of case studies on the role of stochastic  models in scientific investigation.  Statistical ideas have been part of neurophysiology and the brainsciences since the first stochastic description of spike trains, and the quantal hypothesis of neurotransmitter release, more than 50 years ago. Many contemporary theories of neural system behavior are built  with statistical models. For example, integrate-and-fire neurons are  usually assumed to be driven in part by stochastic noise; the role of  spike timing involves the distinction between Poisson and non-Poisson  neurons; and oscillations are characterized by decomposing variation  into frequency-based components.  In the visual system, V1 simple  cells are often described using linear-nonlinear Poisson models; in  the motor system, neural response may involve direction tuning; and  CA1 hippocampal receptive field plasticity has been characterized  using dynamic place models.  It has also been proposed that  perceptions, decisions, and actions result from optimal (Bayesian)  combination of sensory input with previously-learned regularities; and  some investigators report new insights from viewing whole-brain  pattern responses as analogous to statistical classifiers.  Throughout the field of statistics, models incorporating random ``noise components are used as an effective vehicle for data analysis. In neuroscience, however, the models also help form a conceptual framework for understanding neural function.

Each of these two courses serves as a standalone as an introduction to entrepreneurship, and the courses also provide a background for those seeking an entrepreneurship concentration or an in-depth Track immersion.  45805 emphasizes developing an understanding of entrepreneurial thought, mindset, and action, and then progresses thru idea generation, and screening for patterns to predict success, and which underlie entrepreneurial decision making for enterprise creation and growth. The focus is on identification of recognizing the difference between an idea and an opportunity first. Then we progress on how to develop a competitive advantage and a sustainable business model that creates, captures, and delivers value to the market.  High-growth ventures include tech-based ventures, small and medium enterprises (SMEs) with high growth potential, typically ranging from 20 to 50 annually (not lifestyle ventures). The course also incorporates some fundamental aspects of building a team and financing the opportunity, whether it is a technology-based, venture capital financed opportunity or other ventures more suitable for alternative financing vehicles.

Students will gain a perspective of various current theories and models of innovation, how innovations are brought to the market and positioned for successful launch and subsequent growth.  Students study and discuss both successful and unsuccessful attempts to bring innovations to the market via a series of lectures, readings, and case discussions.  The first mini course focuses on the upfront strategic market thinking that must be the basis of a proactive and potent business plan to introduce innovations to the marketplace.  It is the result of intense understanding of the SET factors (social, economic, and technology) and industry dynamics into which the opportunity will be introduced.  It is strategic because of rapid changes in the marketplace and the competitive-set which the opportunity must confront for execution in the emerging marketplace (emergent strategy or agile approach).  Student teams are expected to take on a project determined by the team (with faculty approval) or framed by an outside organization (within or external to CMU).  The goal of the project in Mini 1 is to understand the industry dynamics and competitive set, to identify a market based on use of an agile needs-driven innovation methodology (job + job executor + context defines the market), and to segment the market based on identification of jobs to be done by the job executors.

The model is employed to show how central banking shapes equilibrium in the banking system and how banking and central banking help determine employment, output, inflation, and financial market equilibrium beyond the banking system. Bank lending, interest on bank loans, the M2 money stock, and the interbank interest rate are explored in terms of the model.  A stylized history of financial intermediation explains the coexistence of banking, bond finance, and equity finance. The fundamental fragility of money and banking is explained via its evolution and the origins of the financial crisis of 2007-09. We see why higher minimum equity capital requirements for banks are the best regulatory means of maintaining a healthy and stable financial system.  We identify the intended and unintended consequences for banking stability of central bank last resort lending. Actual Federal Reserve monetary and credit policies in the financial crisis are evaluated using the model. Finally, the model is employed to show how quantitative easing (QE) at the zero interest bound works in the banking system, and to see why the payment of interest on bank reserve balances at the central bank will play a central role in the exit from the zero interest bound.",None,None,"Money, Banking & Financial Markets",6.0,Tepper School of Business,"Goodfriend, Marvin",Graduate,45-810

Determining the price of a product or service is one of the most important marketing decisions. It is also one of the most complex and least understood aspects of marketing. While many marketing activities are geared toward creating value for the customer, sound pricing decisions are the fundamental tool for businesses to capture the value they create. In todays hypercompetitive environment, even slight errors in determining the best price can lead to large financial losses. This course draws on the fundamental disciplines of microeconomics, statistics and psychology to shed light on good pricing practice. It surveys some popular pricing practices, explores their pitfalls, and identifies the fallacies they are based on. The first part of the course discusses the foundations for sound pricing decisions: costs, customer and competition. It then moves on to current pricing strategies, tactics and their applications: pricing over the product life cycle; product line pricing; pricing through the marketing channel; price discrimination; two-part tariffs and nonlinear pricing; price bundling; perceived value pricing; and competitive pricing. The course objectives are (1) to build the right pricing philosophy that guides everyday marketing activities, (2) to introduce a framework, based on concepts drawn from cognitive psychology, economics and industrial organization, to study pricing decisions, and (3) to master some concrete analytical and numerical tools for its successful creation, utilization, and management of sound pricing decisions",None,None,Pricing Strategy,6.0,Tepper School of Business,"Boatwright, Peter",Graduate,45-831

However, facilities are not necessarily connected in a serial fashion, despite its name. Therefore, a supply chain really describes a network of interconnected value-add transformations.  Supply chain management (SCM) is the coordination of production, inventory, location, and transportation among the participants in a supply chain to achieve the best mix of responsiveness and efficiency for the market being served (Hugos, 2011).  SCM includes the strategic design of this network, the tactical planning of supply, production, inventory, transportation, and distribution as well as the operational control of the flows of materials, information, money and physical goods.  Traditionally, the goal of SCM has been to maximize profitability or minimize cost.  Typically, this is achieved by matching supply and demand. Increasingly, the concept of risk, arising from uncertainty, disruptions, and need for rapid reaction, have also brought on the need to incorporate agility and responsiveness in the mix of goals.

A major premise of the course is that star performers are made, not born. The difficulty is that workers often do not know how to achieve star performance. Many believe that it results primarily from innate talents or political game playing. Or, they engage in a trial-and-error approach that frequently leads to disappointing productivity results and undermines their self-esteem. In contrast, this course will focus on the work strategies and behaviors that star performers use to distinguish themselves. Students will learn what they need to do for their own development and, if time permits, what they can do to help develop subordinates/co-workers. ** NOTE: This is an experimental course bringing field based research to the classroom.

In addition, the course also discusses potential issues and challenges that are encountered when implementing the outcome of an operations research project in practice.  The course extends known optimization modeling concepts such as variables, objectives and constraints with more abstract modeling concepts such as index sets and parameters, which are indispensable when formulating large-scale optimization models. Furthermore, the course describes how operations research projects can benefit from multiple models that interact to solve the problem.  These (and other) topics are combined with hands-on experience with a professional modeling system.  The course will include a project to be done in small groups as well as weekly programming assignments.  At the end of this course, you will have learned how large-scale optimization problems (involving hundreds or thousands of variables and constraints) can be solved using a professional optimization system.

2960,"Real options analysis is an approach to the management of operational assets that exploits managerial flexibility in decision making and strives to combine it with market-driven valuation of cash flows.  This approach assumes that managers use all the available information when making decisions.  It is thus particularly useful when managing projects that involve dynamic and state-contingent choices among alternatives (options), especially of a strategic nature.  Examples include investing in and developing new products or technology, expanding/reducing manufacturing capacity, and suspending/resuming production. The valuation of financial options is the conceptual basis of real options management (but this course does not assume prior knowledge of this topic).  Real options analysis extends this fundamental market-driven valuation approach to a much broader spectrum of business applications that feature dynamic decision making.  It thus contrasts the standard net present value rule used by static discounted cash flow analysis.  The resulting managerial decisions and asset valuations can be very different when real options analysis is used rather than static discounted cash flow analysis. A unique feature of this course is blending market-based valuation and decision making concepts and techniques within business analytics.  This course thus includes essential content for students seeking managerial and consulting careers in a wide range of industries and settings.

While the most examples will come from macroeconomics, the generality with which the techniques will be presented in this course will make them applicable to a wide range of fields like econometrics, financial economics, marketing, game theory, political economy, and contract theory. To enable efficient application of  numerical tools, this course endeavors to explain not only when and how to use various numerical algorithms but also how and why they work; in other words, the intention of the course is to open up some black boxes and provide the students with a versatile tool set. The course will cover basic topics in numerical methods such as systems of equations, optimization problems, functional approximation and numeric integration. The course will then focus on solving dynamic problems using various approaches to differential equations and dynamic programming. Advanced topics will include perturbation methods and dynamic stochastic games. Students are expected to have basic knowledge of calculus and linear algebra, as well as Matlab or any other programming language.",None,None,Computational Methods for Economics,6.0,Tepper School of Business,"Childers, David",Graduate,47-805

3012,"Modern data in settings such as e-commerce, healthcare, and operations management are almost always complex and in high dimension. Recent computational and algorithmic advances have led to exciting opportunities to leverage this data for analysis and decision making  indeed, these opportunities have already come to fruition in the form of recommender systems, personalized medicine, and pricing. A critical component of this progress has been a set of probabilistic and statistical tools aimed specifically at high-dimensional settings, including concentration inequalities, minimax theory, and random matrix theory; these tools are precisely the subject of this course. In many applications, including the aforementioned examples, the data are most naturally represented as a set of matrices or tensors. This course will be largely focused on these settings: we will cover algorithms and major results for matrix estimation, and see recent results in the burgeoning field of tensor estimation. The ultimate goal of the course is to prepare students to apply these same tools in their own research.",None,None,Applications of High-Dimensional Statistics,6.0,Tepper School of Business,"Li, Andrew",Graduate,47-841

3019,"The past 10 years have seen a number of advances beyond traditional two-wtep GMM estimation. These advances have focused on providing moment-based estimators and hypothesis tests with more accurate approximation to the sampling distributions. Examples include:  continuous updated GMM (Hansen, Heaton and Yaron 1996, JBES), the empirical likelihood estimator (Imbens et al., 1998, Econometrica), and the exponential tilting estimator of (Kitamura and Stutzer, 1997, Econometrica), GEL estimators (Newey and Smith, 2004, Econometrica), Bootstrap GMM (Hall and Horowitz, 1996, Econometrica), GMM with Weak Instruments (Stock and Wright, 2000, Econometrica), Kleibergens k--statistic (Kleibergen, 2005, Econometrica), GMM with Empirical Saddlepoint (Sowell, 2008). For empirical work these estimators are preferred over the traditional two-step GMM estimator.

3030,"This is an advanced topics microeconomics course about information and learning, with a focus on markets for information and model misspecification. The course will be divided into two parts. In the first part, we will study the basic underpinnings of modeling information in economic decisions, including measuring the value of information and information design. We will use these frameworks to study markets for information, including how a platform prices and sells information in an online market, how to design rating systems to incentivize a firms to produce a high quality product, and how a firm provides personalized product recommendations to consumers. In the second part, we will study the foundations of learning in economic settings, with a focus on social learning and experimentation. We will use these models to study how model misspecification (i.e. a systematically incorrect, or misspecified, understanding of the world) impacts learning. Model misspecification can be used to capture many common behavioral biases, such as overconfidence, correlation neglect and the false consensus effect. We will explore how these different biases impact learning in a variety of economic settings, and connect recent theoretical advances to the empirical literature in economics and psychology documenting such biases.",None,None,Advanced Economic Analysis: Advanced Topics in Economic Theory,6.0,Tepper School of Business,"Bohren, Aislinn",Graduate,47-904
